## Details
Bayesian analysis to evaluate the software engineering result considering various predictors related to project estimation. 

* The data is from previously published NASA software projects dataset. 
* Data preprocessing and various plots to study relationship between attributes.
* Use of ulam() to fit various distributions with different likelihoods.
* Comparison of Negative Binomial, Poisson, and Gamma models.
* DAG to show casual relationship between between attributes.
